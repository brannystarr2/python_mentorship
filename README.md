# Python Mentorship Program 

This repository will be used to in the saving of python projects all through the Python Mentorship Program. The mentorship program is being undertaken by Lux Tech Academy in collaboration with Data Science EastAfrica.

You can follow them on twitter at the following handles @DSEAfrica and @lux_academy

The project for week 1 , which is already available in the repository (week1_project.py) , was to create a python function that when you inputs a number the function you have
created checks whether the number belongs to the Fibonacci sequence or not.

The Project for week 2 , which is already available on the repository (week2_project) , was to Write a python program that checks whether a year is leap year or not. You were required to make use of nested if...else to solve this problem.
